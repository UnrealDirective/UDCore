## Cancellable Delay
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|FlowControl`

```cpp
static UDirectiveUtilTask_Delay* CancellableDelay(UObject* WorldContextObject, float Duration);
```

Starts a cancellable delay. When the delay finishes the `Completed` delegate fires. Non-finite and non-positive durations complete on the next timer tick. Call `Cancel` on the async proxy to stop it.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| WorldContextObject | `UObject*` | The world context object. |
| Duration | `float` | The duration of the delay in seconds. |

**Output exec pins:**

- `Completed` (`FOnDelayCompleted`, no params): fired when the delay has completed.

`EndTask` remains available as a deprecated alias for existing Blueprints.

## Update for Duration
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|FlowControl`

```cpp
static UDirectiveUtilTask_UpdateForDuration* UpdateForDuration(
    UObject* WorldContextObject,
    float Duration,
    float UpdateInterval = 0.0f);
```

Reports elapsed time and normalized progress until the duration ends. An update interval of zero runs once per world tick. The final update has an alpha of `1.0` and fires before `Completed`. Game pause stops the timer, and time dilation scales it.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| WorldContextObject | `UObject*` | The world context object. |
| Duration | `float` | The duration in seconds. Non-positive and non-finite values finish on the next tick. |
| UpdateInterval | `float` | The minimum time between updates. Zero updates each tick. |

**Output exec pins:**

- `Updated` (`FOnDurationUpdated`, `float ElapsedTime, float DeltaTime, float Alpha`): fired as game time advances.
- `Completed` (`FOnDurationCompleted`, no params): fired after the final update.

Call `Cancel` on the async proxy to stop without firing either delegate again.

## Repeat with Interval
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|FlowControl`

```cpp
static UDirectiveUtilTask_RepeatWithInterval* RepeatWithInterval(
    UObject* WorldContextObject,
    int32 Count,
    float Interval,
    float InitialDelay = 0.0f);
```

Runs a fixed number of iterations, or forever when Count is `-1`. Zero intervals run once per world tick, and longer intervals fire at most once per frame. The first index is zero. An infinite repeat wraps the index to zero after `MAX_int32`. For a finite count, `Remaining` is the iterations left after the current one; for `-1` it stays `-1`. Game pause stops the timer, and time dilation scales it.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| WorldContextObject | `UObject*` | The world context object. |
| Count | `int32` | Iteration count. `-1` repeats until Cancel. Zero and other negative values complete on the next tick with no iterations. |
| Interval | `float` | The delay between iterations. Zero runs on consecutive ticks. |
| InitialDelay | `float` | The delay before the first iteration. Zero starts on the next tick. |

**Output exec pins:**

- `Iteration` (`FOnRepeatIteration`, `int32 Index, int32 Remaining`): fired once per iteration.
- `Completed` (`FOnRepeatCompleted`, no params): fired after the final finite iteration. Not fired for an infinite count unless you stop with Cancel, which does not fire Completed.

Call `Cancel` on the async proxy to stop without firing either delegate again.

## End Task
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|FlowControl`, `Directive Utilities|Navigation`

```cpp
void UDirectiveUtilTask_Delay::EndTask();
void UDirectiveUtilTask_MoveToLocation::EndTask();
void UDirectiveUtilTask_MoveToActor::EndTask();
```

Ends the async proxy early. `EndTask` is deprecated for cancellable delay; use `Cancel`. On movement tasks, it stops the task and fires `Completed` exactly once with `bSuccess` set to false.

## Async Load Asset
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|AssetManagement`

```cpp
static UDirectiveUtilTask_AsyncLoadAsset* AsyncLoadAsset(UObject* WorldContextObject, const TSoftObjectPtr<UObject> Asset);
```

Asynchronously loads the asset referenced by a soft object pointer. `Completed` fires with the loaded asset on success; `Failed` fires with null on failure. Call `Cancel` on the async proxy to abort the load (a manual cancel does not broadcast `Failed`).

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| WorldContextObject | `UObject*` | The world context object. |
| Asset | `const TSoftObjectPtr<UObject>` | The soft object reference to load. |

**Output exec pins:**
- `Completed` (`FOnAsyncLoadAssetCompleted`, `UObject* LoadedAsset`): fired when the asset has finished loading; `LoadedAsset` is valid.
- `Failed` (`FOnAsyncLoadAssetCompleted`, `UObject* LoadedAsset`): fired when the load failed; `LoadedAsset` is null.

## Async Load Class
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|AssetManagement`

```cpp
static UDirectiveUtilTask_AsyncLoadClass* AsyncLoadClass(UObject* WorldContextObject, const TSoftClassPtr<UObject> AssetClass);
```

Asynchronously loads the class referenced by a soft class pointer. `Completed` fires with the loaded class on success; `Failed` fires with null on failure. Call `Cancel` on the async proxy to abort the load (a manual cancel does not broadcast `Failed`).

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| WorldContextObject | `UObject*` | The world context object. |
| AssetClass | `const TSoftClassPtr<UObject>` | The soft class reference to load. |

**Output exec pins:**
- `Completed` (`FOnAsyncLoadClassCompleted`, `UClass* LoadedClass`): fired when the class has finished loading; `LoadedClass` is valid.
- `Failed` (`FOnAsyncLoadClassCompleted`, `UClass* LoadedClass`): fired when the load failed; `LoadedClass` is null.

## Async Load Assets
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|AssetManagement`

```cpp
static UDirectiveUtilTask_AsyncLoadAssets* AsyncLoadAssets(UObject* WorldContextObject, const TArray<TSoftObjectPtr<UObject>>& Assets);
```

Asynchronously loads the assets referenced by an array of soft object pointers in a single request. `Completed` fires exactly once with the loaded assets in input order; entries that were unset or failed to resolve are null, and the assets are only guaranteed alive during the broadcast. An empty input array completes immediately with an empty array. `Progress` fires as assets arrive (it is not called when the request finishes before the first update, e.g. all assets were already in memory). Call `Cancel` on the async proxy to abort the load (a manual cancel does not broadcast `Completed`).

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| WorldContextObject | `UObject*` | The world context object. |
| Assets | `const TArray<TSoftObjectPtr<UObject>>&` | The soft object references to load. |

**Output exec pins:**
- `Completed` (`FOnAsyncLoadAssetsCompleted`, `const TArray<UObject*>& LoadedAssets`): fired exactly once when the batch has finished loading; `LoadedAssets` is in input order with null entries for references that were unset or failed to resolve.
- `Progress` (`FOnAsyncLoadAssetsProgress`, `int32 LoadedCount, int32 TotalCount`): fired as assets arrive, with the number loaded so far and the total requested.

## Cancel
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|AssetManagement`

```cpp
void UDirectiveUtilTask_AsyncLoadAsset::Cancel();
void UDirectiveUtilTask_AsyncLoadClass::Cancel();
void UDirectiveUtilTask_AsyncLoadAssets::Cancel();
```

Cancels an in-progress async load proxy and marks it ready to destroy. Manual cancellation does not fire `Failed` for single asset/class loads and does not fire `Completed` for batch asset loads.

## Async Line Trace By Channel
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|Collision`

```cpp
static UDirectiveUtilTask_AsyncTrace* AsyncLineTraceByChannel(UObject* WorldContextObject, const FVector Start, const FVector End, const ETraceTypeQuery TraceChannel, const bool bMultiTrace = false);
```

## Async Capsule Trace By Channel
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|Collision`

```cpp
static UDirectiveUtilTask_AsyncTrace* AsyncCapsuleTraceByChannel(UObject* WorldContextObject, const FVector Start, const FVector End, const float Radius, const float HalfHeight, const ETraceTypeQuery TraceChannel, const bool bMultiTrace = false);
```

Queues a capsule sweep against the given trace channel and reports the result on the next tick. The sweep cannot be cancelled.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| WorldContextObject | `UObject*` | The world context object. |

## Async Move To Location
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|Navigation`

```cpp
static UDirectiveUtilTask_MoveToLocation* MoveToLocation(
    UObject* WorldContextObject,
    AController* Controller,
    FVector Destination,
    float AcceptanceRadius = 100.0f,
    bool bCheckStuckMovement = true,
    float StuckThreshold = 1.0f,
    bool bDebugLineTrace = false);
```

Moves the actor to the specified location; when movement succeeds or fails the `Completed` delegate fires with the result, exactly once. The task automatically ends if the controller, pawn, or world is unavailable, if path-following stops for any reason (success still requires ending within `AcceptanceRadius`), or if `bCheckStuckMovement` is enabled and the controller gets stuck. Negative and non-finite radius and threshold values are clamped to zero. Call `EndTask` on the async proxy to manually end the task when it is no longer needed.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| WorldContextObject | `UObject*` | The world context object. |
| Controller | `AController*` | The controller to move. |
| Destination | `FVector` | The vector location to move to. |
| AcceptanceRadius | `float` | The radius around the destination considered acceptable. Set this to a reasonable value as the controller may never reach the exact destination. |
| bCheckStuckMovement | `bool` | Check if the controller gets stuck while moving. |
| StuckThreshold | `float` | The distance threshold to consider the controller stuck. |
| bDebugLineTrace | `bool` | Display a line trace to the destination location for a short duration. |

**Output exec pins:**
- `Completed` (`FOnAsyncMoveToLocation`, `bool bSuccess`): fired when the movement has completed regardless of success; `bSuccess` indicates whether the destination was reached.

## Async Move To Actor
**Type:** Blueprint Callable &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Category:** `Directive Utilities|Navigation`

```cpp
static UDirectiveUtilTask_MoveToActor* MoveToActor(
    UObject* WorldContextObject,
    AController* Controller,
    AActor* Goal,
    float AcceptanceRadius = 100.0f,
    bool bCheckStuckMovement = true,
    float StuckThreshold = 1.0f);
```

Moves the controller's pawn to the goal actor; when movement succeeds or fails the `Completed` delegate fires with the result, exactly once. The goal's location is re-read every poll, so a moving goal is tracked. The task automatically ends if the controller, pawn, goal actor, or world is unavailable, if path-following stops for any reason (success still requires ending within `AcceptanceRadius` of the goal), or if `bCheckStuckMovement` is enabled and the controller gets stuck. Negative and non-finite radius and threshold values are clamped to zero. Call `EndTask` on the async proxy to manually end the task when it is no longer needed.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| WorldContextObject | `UObject*` | The world context object. |
| Controller | `AController*` | The controller to move. |
| Goal | `AActor*` | The actor to move to. |
| AcceptanceRadius | `float` | The radius around the goal actor considered acceptable. Set this to a reasonable value as the controller may never reach the goal's exact location. |
| bCheckStuckMovement | `bool` | Check if the controller gets stuck while moving. |
| StuckThreshold | `float` | The distance threshold to consider the controller stuck. |

**Output exec pins:**
- `Completed` (`FOnAsyncMoveToActor`, `bool bSuccess`): fired when the movement has completed regardless of success; `bSuccess` indicates whether the goal was reached.
