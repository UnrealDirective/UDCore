## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- Added `Append Array Optimized`, a wildcard array node that bulk-copies plain-data elements and retains Unreal's property-aware path for managed values.
- Added `Insert Array Optimized`, a wildcard array node that inserts a source array with one structural move.
- Added `Remove At Indices`, a stable wildcard array node that removes multiple indices in one pass.
- Added `Remove All Occurrences`, a stable wildcard array node that removes matching values in one pass, with same-build comparisons against Unreal's `Remove Item`.
- Added keyed runtime stopwatches for measuring elapsed real time in milliseconds from Blueprints.
- Added transform variants for grid, hex, circle, arc, and spline point generation, plus facing transforms from locations.
- Added distance-weighted sampling of location and transform arrays, including closed loops.
- Added hex coordinate queries for rectangular grids, rings, ranges, lines, and cell corners.
- Added Perlin noise offsets for location and transform arrays.
- Added transform easing and element-wise location/transform array easing with optional per-element alphas.
- Added `Linear` to `EDirectiveUtilEaseType` (appended so existing Blueprint ordinals stay stable).
- Added `EDirectiveUtilSplineSpacingMode` (Fixed/Even) and `EDirectiveUtilRadialOrientation` for generated transforms.
- Added spline sampling by count, coordinate space, and start/end distance range.
- Added a local release gate for Python checks, Fab validation, UE 5.6-5.8 editor and packaged tests, Shipping coverage, performance regression checks, and release-text scanning.
- `Repeat with Interval` accepts `Count = -1` to repeat until Cancel; `Remaining` stays `-1` while running.

### Changed
- Callable array, random-stream, and collection-generator nodes no longer carry ineffective `BlueprintThreadSafe` metadata. Pure functions retain thread-safe metadata where Unreal can use it.
- `Generate Points Along Spline` keeps `Include Endpoint` as the third pin; Spacing Mode and later options follow it so existing Blueprint and C++ call sites keep their meaning.
- Point, transform, grid, and multi-cell hex generators use execution pins so their allocation cost stays explicit in Blueprint graphs.
- Keyed stopwatches share synchronized state across threads.
- Math formatting, statistics, easing, and random implementations build in focused translation units without changing the public Blueprint library.

### Fixed
- Fab packages omit repository release files, unused source artwork, and empty local directories while retaining the required code-plugin structure.
- Plugin metadata now declares its target platforms, documentation, and editor-only dependency scope.
- Generated collections reject requests above 1,000,000 elements before allocating or iterating.
- Infinite interval repeats wrap their Blueprint index to zero after `MAX_int32` without signed overflow.
- Delta-angle and angle-interpolation nodes remove any number of full turns consistently on UE 5.6-5.8.
- Wildcard append, insert, indexed removal, and value removal now run through compiled Blueprint VM tests for Boolean, string, object, and struct arrays.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- Array sampling with optional replacement, seeded sampling, zero-based pagination, and natural sorting for string and name arrays.
- Weighted array sampling with optional replacement and deterministic random-stream support.
- Cancellable duration updates and fixed-count interval repeats for runtime Blueprints.
- Typed runtime queries for world type, build configuration, and build target.
- Editor slow tasks with progress, cancellation checks, and explicit finish.
- Editor notifications with neutral, success, warning, and failure states.
- Read-only asset audits for unreferenced candidates, missing references, dependency cycles, disk use, dependency counts, referencer counts, primary assets, and CSV export.
- Read-only Blueprint inspection by compile status, parent class, interface, component class, and unused variables.
- Undoable actor alignment, distribution, and surface snapping with explicit actor inputs and changed/skipped results.
- Automation coverage for the new runtime and editor nodes.
- Runtime flow tests and weighted sampling benchmarks across varied collection sizes and sample counts.
- A local runtime test host that runs automation in Unreal Editor and a packaged Development game without changing the released plugin descriptor.

### Changed
- Duplicate removal, distinct copies, and most-common lookup use property hashes when Unreal exposes them.
- Sparse sampling no longer allocates an index for every source item. POD rotation uses bulk moves, while managed values keep property-aware swaps.
- Natural sorting caches comparison data instead of rebuilding it during each comparison.
- Numeric medians use selection instead of sorting the full array. Fuzzy string matching reuses its working buffers.
- Gameplay Tag depth and ancestry queries walk parent tags instead of splitting names into arrays.
- Added repeatable runtime performance tests with CSV baselines for the optimized operations.
- Added table-driven and seeded correctness cases from empty inputs through 4,096 items.
- Runtime automation can now execute in packaged clients, and wildcard pin tests cover every generic array and map node.
- Added a cross-platform packager for engine-specific Fab source archives.
- Declared the supported platforms on every plugin module and aligned the module documentation.
- Save Game slot operations now document their portable flat-filename requirement.

### Fixed
- Array slice, distinct, sampling, and pagination functions now support using the same array as both input and output.
- Generic array outputs reject mismatched element types without modifying the destination array.
- Weighted sampling without replacement stays unique across the full range of finite float weights.
- Movement tasks clear their timers when the controller or pawn becomes invalid and cannot reactivate after completion.
- Editor slow tasks reject non-finite work and overlapping tasks, remain alive until finished, and close during module shutdown.
- Legacy Map Append migration preserves the original node and its links when conversion fails.
- Actor filters skip invalid actors, and missing-texture filtering detects unset texture expressions.
- Actor layout operations reject non-finite inputs and report failed transform changes as skipped.
- Asset Registry queries start the full scan before waiting, and dependency cycle audits handle deep graphs without recursive traversal.
- Windows runtime verification invokes the packaged build command correctly and waits for the packaged game to exit.
- Array sampling rejects unsafe allocation sizes, pagination avoids integer overflow, and float medians return `NaN` for inputs containing `NaN`.
- Async actions stop on world cleanup, and immediate asset-load completions resolve without relying on an assigned streamable handle.
- AI movement cancellation stops active path following, and acceptance checks use horizontal distance.
- Viewport focus skips invalid actors and uses the current level viewport during PIE.
- Asset audits recognize loaded packages, allow default path exclusions to be disabled, and avoid copying dependency arrays during cycle detection.
- Unused Blueprint variable queries omit externally accessible variables by default.
- Clipboard reads are callable nodes so Blueprint execution order remains explicit.
- Fab packaging rejects dirty working trees unless explicitly overridden.
- Added the required publisher notice to every C++ source and header file.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- `Slice` and `Get Distinct` now support using the source array as the output, including arrays with non-trivial element types.
- Array mutators expose mutable pins correctly, and next/previous index helpers handle the full `int32` range without overflow.
- Duration formatting no longer emits `-0m`, handles large finite inputs safely, and weighted selection ignores non-finite weights.
- Bare filename validation rejects `.` and `..`, including when used for save-slot operations.
- Delay and movement tasks handle non-finite values, missing worlds, negative thresholds, and exact-radius completion safely.
- Gameplay Tag registry queries no longer advertise worker-thread safety.

### Changed
- Plugin modules build cleanly with explicit includes and unity builds disabled.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- `Append` now resolves both map pins from either connected map, rejects mismatched key or value types, and upgrades existing nodes when their Blueprints load.

## [2.0] - 2026-07-03

### BREAKING: plugin renamed to Directive Utilities
- Plugin, modules, and C++ classes renamed (UDCore → DirectiveUtilities; modules `DirectiveUtilitiesRuntime`/`DirectiveUtilitiesEditor`; classes `UDirectiveUtil*`, async tasks `UDirectiveUtilTask_*`).
- Blueprint assets migrate automatically via bundled CoreRedirects.
- C++ consumers must update Build.cs module names, include paths, and API macros.
- Blueprint palette categories unified under `Directive Utilities|...` (previously `UDCore|...` and `Unreal Directive Toolkit|...`).
- See [Documentation/Migration-2.0.md](Documentation/Migration-2.0.md) for the full migration guide and rename tables.

### Added
- **Array & Map function libraries**: wildcard utility nodes that extend the built-in container operations, including map reverse lookup (`Get Keys By Value`, `Has Value`), bulk removal (`Remove Keys`), and merging (`Append`).
- **Math function library**: easing curves, weighted random selection, rounding helpers, Perlin noise, angle utilities, numeric array statistics (`Sum`, `Average`, `Median`, `StandardDeviation` for int and float arrays), and humanized formatting (`FormatBytes`, `FormatDuration`, `FormatRelativeTime`).
- **Regex function library**: pattern matching, capture groups, and replacement helpers.
- **Save Game function library**: save-slot enumeration, slot timestamps, byte-based save/load helpers, and slot management (`DoesSaveSlotExist`, `DeleteSaveSlot`, and `RenameSaveSlot`; rename never loses the original slot on failure).
- **String function library**: `IsValidFileName` and `SanitizeFileName` (save-slot validation shares them), `FindBestStringMatch` fuzzy matching, case conversion (`SplitIntoWords`, `ToCamelCase`, `ToPascalCase`, `ToSnakeCase`, `ToKebabCase`), hex encoding/decoding for strings and byte arrays, and `Md5`/`Sha1`/`Crc32` hashing (UTF-8, integrity/cache use).
- **Text function library**: text manipulation helpers.
- **Gameplay Tag function library**: hierarchy navigation in both directions (depth, leaf name, segments, parents, `GetTagChildren`, `GetTagDirectChildren`, `GetTagCommonAncestor`, `GetTagAtDepth`, `GetTagSiblings`, `IsLeafTag`) and registry search (`FindRegisteredTags`).
- **Enhanced Input**: subsystem getters and input mapping context mutators (add, remove, swap, clear, query).
- **Async task nodes**: `Delay`, `Async Load Asset`, `Async Load Class`, `Async Load Assets` (batch, with progress and cancel), `Async Trace`, `Move To Location`, and `Move To Actor`.
- **Utility function library**: `HasCommandLineSwitch` and `GetCommandLineOption` for reading launch options from Blueprints.
- **Editor Asset utilities** (`DirectiveUtilEditorAssetLibrary`): editor scripting helpers for querying and managing assets.
- **Automation tests** covering all function libraries.
- Plugin icon (SVG source).

### Deprecated
- `SortStringArray` and `GetSortedStringArray`: UE 5.6+ ships a built-in `Sort String Array` node; both will be removed in the next major version.

### Changed
- Relicensed under the MIT License and standardized copyright headers across the codebase.
- Expanded the Editor Actor Subsystem with additional filters and utilities.
- Adopted a rolling "latest three engine versions" support policy (UE 5.6-5.8); dropped UE 5.5 support and removed its `UEditorActorSubsystem` regression workaround.
- Plugin Core Redirects load from `DefaultDirectiveUtilities.ini`, matching Unreal's current plugin config naming convention.
- `RoundToDecimals` and `RoundToDecimalsAsText` both round half away from zero.
- Static-mesh-name getters use case-insensitive substring matching, matching the filters.
- The mobility filter and getter both test the root component's mobility.
- `Push Override Materials To Source` runs as a single undoable transaction.
- `NetCore` is now a public dependency of the Directive Utilities runtime module.

### Fixed
- Crash-safety hardening: clamp the dot product in `AngleBetweenVectors` to prevent `NaN`, validate save-slot names against empty/path-traversal input, and null-guard editor subsystem access in headless contexts.
- Corrected operator-precedence and added missing null-guards in Editor Actor Subsystem filters.
- Added a null-check when resolving the player controller in the Enhanced Input helpers.
- Corrected the `SortStringArray` deprecation message to reference `GetSortedStringArray`.
- `TruncateString` safely handles maximum lengths shorter than the requested suffix.
- Weighted random selection ignores non-positive weights and never returns a zero-weight entry.
- Enhanced Input add/remove operations report failure when none of the requested mapping contexts load.
- Cancellable Delay resolves the supplied world context and completes for zero or negative durations.
- `Move To Location` completes when path-following stops, and `Completed` fires exactly once.
- `AddInputMappingContexts` no longer clears existing mappings when every new context fails to load.
- `GetSaveSlotTimestamp` returns local time as documented.
- Zero-width regex matches are ignored by `Find All` and `Replace All`.
- Editor Actor Subsystem filters apply Include/Exclude once per actor, including actors with multiple components.
- World-location filters use spherical distance; box and capsule containment respect component transforms and actual shape geometry.
- Texture filters recognize both Texture Sample and Texture Object material expressions.
- Vertex and triangle queries include child-actor mesh components and skip meshes without valid LOD0 render data.
- `FilterEmptyActors` Include/Exclude are now exact complements.
- `GetActorsByBoundingBox` matches bounds within the given box instead of exact equality.
- The lightmap-resolution filter honors `bOverrideLightMapRes`.
- Editor asset queries wait for the asset-registry scan to complete.
- Packaged builds now include the README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, and Documentation folder.
- Gameplay Tag nodes that query the tag manager no longer claim worker-thread safety.
- Duplicate asset searches return each matching asset path once when directories overlap.
- Async action factories handle null world contexts without emitting engine-level warnings.
